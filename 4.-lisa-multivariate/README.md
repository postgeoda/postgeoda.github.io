# 4. Local Spatial Autocorrelation -Multivariate ðŸ’ 

The multivariate local spatial autocorrelation is a class of statistics that assesses the match between the distance among observations in attribute space and geographical space. They are used to identify observations that are both close in multiattribute space and close in geographical space.
