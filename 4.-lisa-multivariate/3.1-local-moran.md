# 4.1 Local Neighbor Match Test

The local neighbor match test \([2020](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/6c_local_multi/lab6c.html#ref-AnselinLi:20)\) is a method to identify significant locations by assessing the extent of overlap between k-nearest neighbors in geographical space and k-nearest neighbors in multi-attribute space. For more information, please read [https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/6c\_local\_multi/lab6c.html\#local-neighbor-match-test](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/6c_local_multi/lab6c.html#local-neighbor-match-test)

## neighbor\_match\_test\(\)

{% hint style="info" %}
neighbor\__match\_test_\(\) is a PostgreSQL WINDOW function. Please call it  with an OVER clause.
{% endhint %}

### Synopsis

Short version:

```sql
float[] neighbor_match_test(geometry the_geom, anyarray vals, integer k)
```

Long version:

```sql
float[] neighbor_match_test(geometry the_geom, anyarray vals, integer k,
    character varying scale_method,
    character varying distance_method
)
```

Full version:

```sql
float[] neighbor_match_test(geometry the_geom, anyarray vals, integer k,
    character varying scale_method,
    character varying distance_method
    float power, 
    boolean is_inverse, 
    boolean is_arc
    boolean is_mile
)
```

### Arguments

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| the\_geom | geometry | the geometry column \(only points and polygons are supported\) |
| vals | _anyarray_ | an array of numeric columns that contains the values for neighbor match test |
| k | integer | k nearest neighbor for both attribute and geographical space |
| scale\_method | character varying | the scaling method applies on _vals_. Options are {'_raw_', '_standardize_', '_demean_', '_mad_', '_range\_standardize_', '_range\_adjust_'}. Default: '_standardize_' |
| distance\_method | character varying | the distance metric used to measure the distance in attribute space of input _vals_. Options are {'_euclidean_', '_manhattan_'. Default: '_euclidean_'. |
| power | float | the power/exponent corresponds to the number of times the base \(dist\_band\) is used as a factor. Default: 1. |
| is\_inverse | boolean | if apply inverse on distance value. Default: False. |
| is\_arc | boolean | if compute arc distance between two observations. Default: FALSE. |
| is\_mile | boolean | if convert distance unit from mile to kilometer\(KM\). Default: TRUE. |

### Return

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| float\[\] | an array contains 2 values, which are {'_cardinality_', '_probability_'}  |

{% hint style="info" %}
**cardinality**: the number of common neighbors for each location
{% endhint %}

### Examples

Apply local neighbor match test on 6 nearest neighbors of the variables \["hr60", "ue60"\] \(homicide and unemployment rate 1960 in [natregimes dataset](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/natregimes/)\):

{% hint style="info" %}
Please see chapter '[Contiguity Based Weights](../2.-spatial-weights/2.1-contiguity-based-weights.md)' for how to create a Queen contiguity weights.
{% endhint %}

```sql
SELECT neighbor_match_test(the_geom, ARRAY[hr60, ue60], 6) OVER() FROM natregimes;
