# 5. Spatial Clustering ðŸŒŒ

Spatial Constrained Clustering methods are used to divide an original set of _n_ spatial units into _p_ internally connected regions that maximize within similarity. 

PostGeoDa offers two popular spatial constrained clustering algorithms: _SKATER_ \(AssunÃ§Ã£o et al. [2006](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/9c_spatial3/lab9c.html#ref-Assuncaoetal:06)\) and _REDCAP_ \(Guo [2008](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/9c_spatial3/lab9c.html#ref-Guo:08); Guo and Wang [2011](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/9c_spatial3/lab9c.html#ref-GuoWang:11)\). SKATER stands for _Spatial \`Kâ€™luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal_, and obtains regionalization through a graph partitioning approach. REDCAP stands for _REgionalization with Dynamically Constrained Agglomerative clustering and Partitioning_, and consists of a family of six hierarchical regionalization methods.
