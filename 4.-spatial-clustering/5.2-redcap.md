# 5.2 REDCAP

 Regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning \(REDCAP\) is developed by D. Guo \(2008\). Like SKATER, REDCAP starts from building a spanning tree in 4 different approaches \(single-linkage, average-linkage, complete-linkage, and wards-linkage\). Then, REDCAP provides 2 different approaches \(first‚Äêorder and full-order constraining\) to prune the tree to find clusters. The REDCAP with first-order approach using a minimum spanning tree is exactly the same as SKATER. For more information, please read [https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/9c\_spatial3/lab9c.html\#redcap](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/9c_spatial3/lab9c.html#redcap)

## redcap\(\)

### Synopsis

Short version 1:

```sql
integer redcap(integer k, anyarray vals, bytea weights, 
    character varying method
)
```

Short version 2:

```sql
integer skater(integer k, anyarray vals,  bytea weights, 
    character varying method, integer min_region_size
)
```

Short version 3:

```sql
integer redcap(integer k, anyarray vals,  bytea weights, 
    character varying method, numeric bound_vas, float min_bound
)
```

Full version 1:

```sql
integer redcap(integer k, anyarray vals,  bytea weights, 
    character varying method, integer min_region_size,
    character varying scale_method,
    character varying distance_type,
    integer seed,
    integer cpu_threads)

```

Full version 2:

```sql
integer redcap(integer k, anyarray vals,  bytea weights, 
    character varying method, numeric bound_val, float min_bound,
    character varying scale_method,
    character varying distance_type,
    integer seed,
    integer cpu_threads)

```

### Arguments

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| k | integer  | the number of clusters |
| vals | anyarray | an array of the numeric columns that contains the values for skater  |
| weights | bytea | a bytea column that stores the spatial weights information |
| method | character varying | the redcap method. Options are {"_firstorder-singlelinkage_", "_fullorder-completelinkage_", "_fullorder-averagelinkage_","_fullorder-singlelinkage_", "_fullorder-wardlinkage_"} |
| bound\_val | numeric | the numeric column of a bound variable |
| min\_bound | float | the minimum bound value that applies to all clusters |
| scale\_method | character varying | the scaling method applies to _vals_. Options are {'_raw_', '_standardize_', '_demean_', '_mad_', '_range\_standardize_', '_range\_adjust_'}. Default: '_standardize_' |
| distance\_method | character varying | the distance metric used to measure the distance in attribute space of input _vals_. Options are {'_euclidean_', '_manhattan_'. Default: '_euclidean_'. |
| seed | integer | the seed for random number generator used in LISA statistics. Default: 123456789. |
| cpu\_threads | integer | the number of CPU threads used for parallel LISA computation. Default: 6. |

### Return

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| integer | the cluster indicator |

### Examples

Apply redcap \(fullorder-completelinkage\) to create 10 spatially constrained clusters using variable \["hr60", "ue60", "dv60"\] \(homicide, unemployment, divorce rate 1960 in [natregimes dataset](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/natregimes/)\) and queen contiguity weights "queen\_w":

{% hint style="info" %}
Please see chapter '[Contiguity Based Weights](../2.-spatial-weights/2.1-contiguity-based-weights.md)' for how to create a Queen contiguity weights.
{% endhint %}

```sql
SELECT redcap(10, ARRAY[hr60, ue60, dv60], queen_w, 'fullorder-completelinkage') OVER() FROM natregimes;
